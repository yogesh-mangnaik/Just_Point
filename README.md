## ImmARsive News
Imagine you are reading a news about the cricket match last night which you unfortunately missed out on. Wouldn't it be easy if you could just watch the highligts right away without the hassle of going through the internet searching for a video. Or watch the statement given by a political leader at a rally.
The **ImmARsive News** module lets users view a movie trailer or watch the news over the surface of a newspaper by viewing it under our AR lens.
Interactive AR-based newspaper based on Google's [Opensource AR-Code](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/) and Unity3D.<br>
